The following notation is used throughout the remainder. 
$\Expect[x]$ is the expected value of a random variable $x$.
Bold font, lower-case letters ($\vx$) and upper-case letters ($\mX$) denote vector and matrices respectively and all vectors are assumed to be column vectors unless noted otherwise. 
The transpose and hermetian of $\mX$ are denoted by $\mX^T$ and $\mX^H$ respectively.
$\mI_N$ denotes the identity matrix of dimension $N$.
For square $\mX$ with dimension $N\times N$ the normalized trace is denoted by $\Tr(\mX)  = \underset{N \rightarrow \infty}{\text{lim}}
\Expect[\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N x_{i,i}]$
